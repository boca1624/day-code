**Constructing Greedy Example**

I've decided to craft a Python code snippet that showcases a greedy approach to the fractional knapsack problem. This will involve calculating value-to-weight ratios, sorting items based on these ratios, and then iterating to maximize the total value within the weight constraint. The code will utilize basic data structures like lists and potentially a simple sort operation, avoiding complex external libraries.
